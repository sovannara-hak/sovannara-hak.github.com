### Active Waiting<a name="activeWaiting"></a>

Those videos were created during my PhD Thesis to illustrate some motion imitation.
The motion to imitate is a waiting motion. This motion is defined by the
unconscious motions that a human performs while doing nothing.
The motions are generated from several human motion capture data focused on the hands,
the chest and the head.
